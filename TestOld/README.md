# Template project folder

This folder includes all files that you should need for your SPECIFIC processor.
Other files such as compiler and libraries are universal and should be somewhere else, like 
your HOME folder (refere to VIDEO1 on YT).

Edit Makefile to include your own libraries and the correct path to stlib (in HOME).
Also you can change output file name and replace YOURUSERNAME to correct path.
